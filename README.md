# C++ Starter Code

This is a C++ template code with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [Google
Test](https://github.com/google/googletest).

Note: I attempt to create a minimal C++ template code with proper build and test.
As always, it's not perfect, please let do me know if anything can be improved.

## Prerequisite

- Install Google Test to your system:
    [Mac](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46611467),
    [Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/Cartexius/4c437c084d6e388288201aadf9c8cdd5).

## Build

```bash
cmake . && make
```

## Test

```bash
cmake . && ctest
```
